<h1>Football System Management</h1>
<p>This project implements a comprehensive football system management application using a layered architecture:</p>
<h4>Backend (Spring Boot + MongoDB/PostgreSQL):</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Handles data persistence and business logic.</li>
  <li>Offers a RESTful API for interactions with the Angular frontend.</li>
  <li>Provides a choice between NoSQL (MongoDB) and SQL (PostgreSQL) databases based on project's specific needs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Frontend (Angular):</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Provides a user-friendly interface for managing players, clubs, leagues, transfers, and standings.</li>
  <li>Utilizes Angular's reactive forms for robust data binding and validation.</li>
  <li>Leverages services to interact with the backend API.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Authorization and Authentication:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Implements a secure JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication flow.</li>
  <li>Generates refresh tokens for long-lived sessions and access tokens for API access.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Real-time Notifications (WebSockets):</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Enables real-time updates on events like asking for permissions for deleting players.</li>
  <li>Utilizes WebSockets for bi-directional communication between the server and client.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Elasticsearch:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Allows users to quickly search for users, leagues, or other relevant entities.</li>
  <li>Filters rounds based on start and end date.</li>
  <li>Sorts players based on height and weight.</li>
</ul>
